          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.Here are some things that might help you.</h1>
          <p>Working as a professional chef gives you the chance to hone a skill that's practical in everyday life. You can apply the techniques you learn at work to the meals you prepare for yourself. As a result, you may be able to prepare healthier meals more efficiently.</p>

          <p>With over a five-year journey of studying of this topic I realized that the the key to a successful kitchen is not only in the way that your food taste. It is also about the passion, about the love and the soul that you put in your food that make people enjoy it and want more.</p>

          <p>A career as a chef allows you to exercise your creativity. You can develop your own recipes or alter to existing ones. You can also experiment with different ways to garnish your dishes and impress customers with visual presentations.</p>

          <p>I have always wanted to follow this path in my life. Since I was a little kid, I belonged in the kitchen. My mom and I were always trying new recipes and I can gladly say that she thaught me everything I know, even though her job did not involved cooking in any form. </p>

          <p>Choosing what career you want to pursue is a difficult decision to make, and it's one that shouldn't be taken lightly. Becoming a chef is an excellent career choice, but, as with every job, it has its ups and downs. The long hours, physical demand, and low starting pay can be a difficult pill to swallow, but if you choose to go into foodservice, you'll be rewarded with a fulfilling job that offers tons of freedom and creativity and is constantly changing.</p>

          <p>If your dream is to be a chef, dream big and work for it, because it is worth it! Although it will demand so much of your free time and your mind will always be working trying to creat new things, it is awesome how you can work with so many wonderful people and see the satisfacion on their face when you contributed on their happiness.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>The restaurant I am a chef at is called "Fork the Restaurant" and it is located in Herastrau Park, in Bucharest. It has a capacity of over 70 people with tables that can fit your whole group of friends. It's the kind of place you look for when you want to have a quiet and peaceful breakfast, a lunch to take all the problems off your mind, or a fun, wild night out. It is perfect for every time of the day.</p>

          <p>Our stuff is very friendly and always at your service. It is the result of over 3 years of culinar journeys and a lot of research. Not only that the menu is very abundant, but if the customer wants to combine and make his own "meal", we are very open to try and satisfy his wishes.</p>
